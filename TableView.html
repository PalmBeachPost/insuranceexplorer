                <p><b>Weiss Ratings, Palm Beach Gardens</b> — Ratings range from A for excellent financial security, including ability to pay claims under severe economic conditions, to E for very weak. Plus sign indicates the upper third of the letter grade and minus sign the lower third. Weiss has been rating property and casualty insurers since 1993 and does not take money from insurers. It says its ratings are consumer-oriented. Ratings are for the latest quarter available.  Website: <a href="http://www.weissratings.com/" target="_blank">weissratings.com</a></p>

                <p><b>Demotech Inc., Dublin, Ohio</b> — A'' is its top financial strength rating, followed by A' and A, and others. NR means not rated by Demotech. Incorporated in 1985, Demotech plays an important role in determining which insurers are considered acceptable in the mortgage lending marketplace. It does not rate state-run Citizens, and covers some but not all affiliates of large, national insurers. Ratings are the latest available on its website: <a href="http://www.demotech.com/" target="_blank">demotech.com</a> The Palm Beach Post's ratings were updated in August 2017.</p>
				
				<p><b>A.M. Best Co., Oldwick, N.J.</b> -- Ratings range from A++ to D. An indicator of "u" shows the company is under review with potentially negative outlook. A.M. Best was founded in 1889. A Best's Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance obligations. It is not a warranty of a company's financial strength and ability to meet its obligations to policy holders. Ratings here are as of March 2017. The most recent ratings, information on the ratings system and a disclaimer notice are available at <A HREF="http://www.ambest.com" target="_blank">AMBest.com</A><p>
				

                <p><b>Complaint rating</b> — This is a ranking based on number of complaints relative to a company’s number of customers. Only companies holding more than 1,000 policies are listed with complaint ratios or become part of the Complaint Rating calculation.
                <ul id="ratinglegend">
                    <li><img src="./icons/icon1.png"/> : Companies with the fewest complaints per capita, ranking in the top third in the state.</li>
                    <li><img src="./icons/icon2.png"/> : Companies ranking in the middle third in the state on complaints per capita.</li>
                    <li><img src="./icons/icon3.png"/> : Bottom third of the companies with the worst complaints per capita ratio.</li>
                    <li><img src="./icons/icon0.png"/> : No complaint data available, or company had fewer than 1,000 policies and a complaint ratio was not calculated. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="notes"><b>Notes</b> —  Complaints are for a four-year period ended Dec. 31, 2016. Customer count is the number of residential customers in Florida as of Sept. 30, 2016, with <!-- two exceptions--> one exception. <!-- Policy counts for Citizens Property Insurance Corp. were adjusted to a newer date, because other companies are taking clients.--> State Farm counts are provided by the company but are not reported to the state. State ranking in market share may vary from county share. Complaints represent those logged by the Florida Department of Financial Services, as obtained by The Palm Beach Post in a records request. State officials consider complaints to include requests for mediation of claims.
